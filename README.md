Skp1 is a subunit of the SCF class of E3 ubiquitin ligases that are important for eukaryotic protein degradation. Unlike its animal counterparts, 
Skp1 from Toxoplasma gondii is hydroxylated by a prolyl4-hydroxylase (PhyA), and the resulting hydroxyproline can
subsequently be modified by a five-sugar chain.similar modification is found in the social amoeba Dictyostelium, where
it regulates SCF assembly and O2-dependent development. In my works in three subsequent papers I have shown that homologous glycosyltransferases assemble a similar core 
trisaccharide in both organisms,but deviate in their modification of final two sugars. Wheresas a bifunctional galactosyltransferase  mediates the addition
of the final two sugars in Dictyostelium, we found that Toxoplasma utilizes two different cytoplasmic glycosyltransferase from an
ancient clade of CAZy family GT32 to catalyze transfer of the fourth and fifth sugars. A genomic bioinformatics survey suggested that Toxoplasma-specific glycosyltransferases 
belong to the ancestral Skp1 glycosylation pathway in protists
and evolved separately from related human and dictyostelium glycosyltransfeases.
